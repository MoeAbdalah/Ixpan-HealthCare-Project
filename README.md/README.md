# **README: Insurance Claims and Population Analysis Project**

## **Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing insurance claims data alongside population demographics to uncover trends, detect anomalies, and derive actionable insights. The analysis aims to understand claims behavior, identify potential policy abuses, and support decision-making through predictive modeling and advanced analytics.

The datasets include sensitive information and cannot be shared publicly. All work follows strict data confidentiality and ethical analysis practices.

## **Project Objectives**

1. **Data Understanding and Cleaning:**
   - Explore and understand the structure of population and claims datasets.
   - Ensure data quality and resolve inconsistencies.

2. **Outlier Detection and Statistical Analysis:**
   - Use statistical and machine learning methods to identify anomalies in claims and cost data.
   - Examine patterns indicating potential abuse or inefficiencies in policy use.

3. **Pattern Analysis and Policy Insights:**
   - Analyze how demographics (e.g., age, marital status) impact claims frequency and cost.
   - Detect patterns in claims timing, healthcare provider costs, and processing outcomes.

4. **Advanced Predictive Modeling:**
   - Prepare the data for predictive analytics to forecast claims costs, frequency, and potential high-risk groups.
   - Test machine learning models (e.g., GLM, Random Forest, Neural Networks).

5. **Reporting and Recommendations:**
   - Generate actionable insights to optimize insurance policies and reduce costs.

## **Project Features**

### **Data Summary**
- **Claims Dataset**: Contains detailed records of insurance claims, including costs, processing times, and healthcare provider details.
- **Population Dataset**: Demographic details of insured individuals, linked to claims data.

### **Key Analyses**
1. **Demographics & Claims Linkage**:
   - Mapped individuals to claims using unique identifiers.
   - Identified high-claim groups based on age, marital status, and other demographics.

2. **Outlier Analysis**:
   - Applied Z-scores, box plots, and machine learning methods like Isolation Forest.
   - Focused on extreme claim costs, unusually frequent claims, and delayed processing times.

3. **Cost & Risk Segmentation**:
   - Segmented population based on claims frequency, cost, and risk levels.
   - Explored the relationship between chronic conditions, maternity claims, and costs.

4. **Healthcare Provider Analysis**:
   - Analyzed costs by provider type, specialty, and in/out-patient services.

5. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Experimented with machine learning models to predict claims frequency and costs.

6. **Time Series Analysis**:
   - Explored seasonal trends in claims and relationships between time gaps and costs.

## **Key Insights**

- **Demographics Impact**: Younger populations and specific family structures were associated with fewer claims, while certain age groups and chronic conditions showed high claim rates.
- **Outliers and Policy Abuse**: Detected patterns in repetitive doctor visits and delayed claim submissions.
- **Cost Trends**: Chronic and maternity claims significantly impacted overall costs, with clear cost variations between healthcare providers.

## **Implementation Notes**

- Database Design: A normalized schema was considered for implementation into software platforms. This includes:
  - Identifying primary keys.
  - Mapping relationships between entities.
  - Structuring data for SQL and NoSQL databases.

- **Tools Used**:
  - Programming: Python, PostgreSQL, SQL.
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Plotly.
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, PyTorch.

## **Next Steps**

1. Refine predictive modeling efforts for claim forecasts.
2. Deep dive into medications and dosage frequency analysis.
3. Implement the normalized database schema for better scalability.
4. Build dashboards for dynamic insights and reporting.
